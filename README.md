Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced projects using python

The above python projects are my first set of projects that I've learned about. I have come across some errors and weird bugs within the code of each project but I managed to overcome them by searching the errors up. Some of the errors and bugs I faced didn't have the results and answers I was looking for. So I had to back-track through my own code and try and snuff out the errors one by one.
Compared to other programming languages I've previously learned about, (e.g C++), Python has been easier to understand, read and create little applications. To other Python Beginners, I wish you the best of luck on your coding journey.
