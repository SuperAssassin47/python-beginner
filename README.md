Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced projects using python

The above python projects are my first set of projects that I've learned about. I have come across some errors and weird bugs within the code of each project but I managed to overcome them by searching the errors up. Some of the errors and bugs I faced didn't have the results and answers I was looking for. So I had to back-track through my own code and try to snuff out the errors one by one through decomposition, which is a method used for computational thinking.

DISCLAIMER: I am a beginner of the Python Programming Language and some of these projects I have completed above I've copied from other people because I wanted to see how they work and learn different techniques from professional programmers so I can implement them into future projects of my own design. Thank you ;)
